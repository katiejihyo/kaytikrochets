      <strong>Assembling it all together:</strong> *I recommend watching video at 8:49*<br><br>
      Hopefully this terribly drawing of mine gives an adequete overview of the steps.
      <img src="/images/star-purse-diagram.png" style="width:600px; margin-bottom:1rem;" />
      Step 1:<br>
      Cut main main color yarn of length greater than your strength (be generous!) and insert into darning<br>
      Stitch the front panel and strap together with darning needle (start from a top corner and go around the
      sides and bottom of the front panel)<br>
      Fasten off when you reach the other side of the front panel.<br><br>
      Step 2: <br>
      Line up back panel and stitch it onto the other side of the strap (be sure to line it up with the front panel).<br>
      Fasten off when done.<br><br>
      Step 3: <br>
      Make sure the strap is not twisted.<br>
      Line up strap and overlap it onto the bag <br>
      Use darning needle yarn and stitch across to attach.<br><br>
      Step 4: Flip bag inside out<br>
      Add buttons or metal clasps (optional)<br><br>
      To attach star:<br>
      Use  darning needle and accent color yarn to go between the outline of the star, inserting your needle through
      both the star and the bag.<br> See video for better visual explanation at 13:00.`
